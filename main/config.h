// Due to the high dynamism of IEEE Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS) matches, the main differences between the teams are focused on their decision-making system, path planning methods, and control and positioning algorithms. A path planning algorithm that fits well in the context of IEEE VSSS differential robots is the univector field navigation. For the positioning of the robots the combination of Delaunay Triangulation and Gouraud Shading proves to be quite efficient. Regarding decision-making, behavior trees are a good approach, due to their modularity and easiness in changing player's actions. In addition, a system for changing player's roles is also important, in order to make a dynamic match possible. The techniques shown here are not novel in the context of robot soccer.
